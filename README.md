(Several folders contain many lesson files; browse them to find specific topics.)

## Getting started
- For static HTML/CSS/JS files: open the HTML files in your browser (double-click), or run a simple local server for routing and fetch requests.

  From PowerShell or Command Prompt (run in repository root):

  ```powershell
  python -m http.server 8000
  ```

  Then open `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser.
- For backend projects (Java, Spring, Node): open the relevant folder and follow that folder's instructions (if present). Use your IDE (Eclipse/STS/IntelliJ) or Node/Java build tools as appropriate.
