   What is file Handling ?
    File handling in Java lets you create, read, write, and delete files—a must-have skill for building real-world applications like loggers, data processors, or configuration managers. Here's a complete overview to get you started:

   📁 Key Classes in java.io Package
    | Class            | Purpose                            |
    +------------------+------------------------------------+
    | File             | Represents file or directory paths |
    | FileReader       | Reads character files              |
    | FileWriter       | Writes character files             |
    | BufferedReader   | Efficient reading of text          |
    | BufferedWriter   | Efficient writing of text          |
    | FileInputStream  | Reads binary data                  |
    | FileOutputStream | Writes binary data                 |



    🛠️ Common File Operations
    1. Create a File
    File file = new File("example.txt");
    if (file.createNewFile()) {
        System.out.println("File created: " + file.getName());
    } else {
        System.out.println("File already exists.");
    }


    2. Write to a File
    FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("example.txt");
    writer.write("Hello, Java File Handling!");
    writer.close();


    3. Read from a File
    FileReader reader = new FileReader("example.txt");
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(reader);
    String line;
    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
        System.out.println(line);
    }
    br.close();


    4. Delete a File
    File file = new File("example.txt");
    if (file.delete()) {
        System.out.println("Deleted the file: " + file.getName());
    } else {
        System.out.println("Failed to delete the file.");
    }



    🔍 Useful File Class Methods
    | Method            | Description                |
    +-------------------+----------------------------+
    | exists()          | Checks if file exists      |
    | getName()         | Returns file name          |
    | getAbsolutePath() | Returns full path          |
    | length()          | Returns file size in bytes |
    | canRead()         | Checks if file is readable |
    | canWrite()        | Checks if file is writable |
    | delete()          | Deletes the file           |

                              writer     (Abstract class)
