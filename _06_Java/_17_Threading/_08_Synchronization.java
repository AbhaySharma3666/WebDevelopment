/*
    ðŸ§  Problem:
    Without synchronization, multiple threads print "We are learning" first,
    then each prints "MultiThreading.." afterward â€” leading to jumbled output.

    ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
    Ensure each thread prints "We are learning MultiThreading.." as a unified message,
    without interleaving with other threads.

    âœ… Solution:
    Use synchronization to make threads execute this critical section one at a time.
