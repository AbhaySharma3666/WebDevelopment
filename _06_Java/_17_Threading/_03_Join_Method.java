        What Is join() in Java?
        The join() method is used to pause the current thread until the thread on which join()
         was called has finished executing.

     Why Use It?
        - Ensures sequential execution in multithreaded programs.
        - Helps avoid race conditions when one thread depends on another‚Äôs result.

     Syntax Variants
       - public final void join() throws InterruptedException
       - public final void join(long millis) throws InterruptedException
       - public final void join(long millis, int nanos) throws InterruptedException

class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread started: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate work
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Thread interrupted");
        }
        System.out.println("Thread finished: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class JoinDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        MyThread t2 = new MyThread();

        t1.start();
        t1.join(); // Wait for t1 to finish

        t2.start();
        t2.join(); // Wait for t2 to finish

        System.out.println("Main thread ends");
    }
}

 without using join method we assume our output is :-   but is wrong               correct output
                                                     Main Thread is stating    |  Main Thread is stating
                                                     aaa , bbb , ccc  (random) |  Main Thread is completed
                                                     Main Thread is completed  |  aaa , bbb , ccc  (random)
