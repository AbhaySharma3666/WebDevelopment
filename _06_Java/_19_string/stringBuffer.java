/*
    What is StringBuffer?
        StringBuffer is a mutable sequence of charactersâ€”unlike String, which is immutable.
        That means you can modify the contents of a StringBuffer object without creating a
        new one each time.

    Key Features
        - Thread-safe: All methods are synchronized, making it safe for use in multithreaded
                        environments.
        - Efficient for modifications: Ideal when you need to frequently change or build strings
                                        dynamically.
