Phases of Events in JavaScript

  Introduction :- Events in JavaScript follow a structured lifecycle, comprising different phases from the moment they occur to when they are handled.

  Events in JavaScript go through three distinct phases:

  -Capturing Phase : In this phase the event goes through the HTML DOM and searches for the target element.

  -Target Phase : This is the phase where the event reaches the target elementâ€”the element on which the event was originally triggered.

  -Bubbling Phase : Following the target phase, the event bubbles up from the target element through its ancestors, propagating outward.
