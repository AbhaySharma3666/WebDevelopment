AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique used in web development to send and receive data from a server asynchronously, without reloading the entire web page. By using AJAX, web applications can update parts of a page dynamically, providing a smoother and more responsive user experience. AJAX commonly uses technologies such as JavaScript, the XMLHttpRequest object, and JSON or XML for data exchange.
